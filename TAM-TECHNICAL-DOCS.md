```

### Note on the logo file
`TAM logo.jpeg` contains the logo on a white document/paper background. It cannot be used directly as a web logo because of the background. The brand needs a **transparent PNG or SVG export** of the logo artwork. Until then, the CSS text logo (`wear.TAM`) is used in the nav and footer.

---

## 4. Site Architecture

The site is a **single-page application (SPA-style)** — one `index.html` with all sections stacked vertically. Navigation uses smooth anchor scroll. No page reloads.

### Sections in order

| Section | ID | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation | `#nav` | Sticky, transparent on hero, bone background on scroll. Logo + links + cart icon + hamburger (mobile) |
| Hero | `#home` | Full-screen video background (TAM-video.mp4), dark overlay, animated headline, CTA buttons |
| Marquee ticker | — | Scrolling text strip: "wear.TAM · The Alisa Musa · Put Together Every Day · New Collection 2026" |
| Collection / Shop | `#collection` | Product grid with filter tabs, product cards, hover effects, quick add |
| Brand Story | `#story` | Split layout — image left, brand copy right, values, stat block |
| Features Strip | — | 4 trust signals: delivery, returns, secure payment, size inclusive |
| Lookbook | `#lookbook` | Horizontal drag-scroll gallery of 6 editorial cards |
| Testimonials | `#testimonials` | 3 customer review cards |
| Instagram / Socials | `#social` | 6-tile grid linking to Instagram, "Follow on Instagram" CTA |
| Newsletter | — | Email signup form (frontend only, no service connected yet) |
| Contact | `#contact` | Brand contact info + contact form (frontend only) |
| Footer | — | Logo, links (Shop, Help, Brand), social icons, copyright |

### Overlays / Modals

| Component | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Cart Drawer | Cart icon in nav | Slides in from right. Shows items, total, checkout button |
| Product Modal | "View" button or product card | Full product detail: image gallery, size selector (standard or custom measurements), Add to Bag, Buy Now |
| Page Loader | On every page load | Brand logo animation fades out after 1.2s |

---

## 5. JavaScript Modules (main.js)

All JS is vanilla, written in self-executing IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) to avoid global scope pollution.

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `initLoader` | Fades out the loader overlay on window load |
| `initCursor` | Custom cursor (dot + follower ring) — disabled on touch devices |
| `initNav` | Scroll-aware nav (transparent to bone), hamburger menu, active link highlighting |
| `initReveal` | IntersectionObserver — animates elements into view on scroll |
| `cart` object | Full cart state: add, remove, save to localStorage, load from localStorage, updateUI |
| `initCartDrawer` | Opens/closes cart drawer, handles item removal |
| `initProductModal` | Opens product modal, populates with product data, handles image thumbnails, size selection |
| `initSizeModeToggle` | Toggles between Standard Size and My Measurements panels |
| `initFilterTabs` | Filters product grid by category |
| `initLookbookDrag` | Mouse drag-to-scroll on lookbook strip |
| `initNewsletter` | Newsletter form submit handler (currently just shows toast) |
| `initContactForm` | Contact form submit handler (currently just shows toast) |
| `showToast` | Utility — shows bottom notification toast |
| `escapeHtml` | Security utility — sanitises strings before inserting into DOM |

### Product Data
Products are currently **hardcoded in `main.js`** as a `products` object (key = product ID). This is a placeholder. When Supabase is added, products will be fetched from the database.

Current products:
| ID | Name | Price | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The TAM Wide-Leg Trouser | ₦45,000 | sets |
| 2 | TAM Trouser + Shirt Set | ₦62,000 | sets |
| 3 | TAM Co-ord Set | ₦62,000 | sets |
| 4 | The Bone Blazer | ₦75,000 | outerwear |
| 5 | Gold Drape Midi | ₦52,000 | dresses |
| 6 | Charcoal Corset Top | ₦22,000 | tops |

Products 1 and 2 use real photos. Products 3–6 use CSS gradient placeholders until real photos are provided.

### Cart Persistence
Cart is saved to `localStorage` under the key `tam_cart`. It persists across page refreshes. Cleared when items are removed.

---

## 6. Size and Measurements System

The product modal has a **two-mode size selector:**

### Mode 1 — Standard Size
Button grid: XS / S / M / L / XL / 2XL / 3XL

### Mode 2 — My Measurements
10 optional fields, all in centimetres:

| Field | Nigerian tailor context |
|---|---|
| Bust | Fullest part of chest |
| Waist | Narrowest part of torso |
| Hips | Fullest part of hips/seat |
| Height | Full body height |
| Shoulder Width | Across back, shoulder to shoulder |
| Sleeve Length | Shoulder to wrist |
| Thigh | Fullest part of thigh |
| Inseam | Crotch to floor |
| Back Length | Nape of neck to waist |
| Neck | Base of neck circumference |

When a customer adds to bag with measurements, the cart item's "size" field is set to a string like:
`"Custom (Bust: 92cm, Waist: 74cm, Hips: 98cm)"`

This is currently stored in localStorage only. When Supabase is added, measurements should be saved to the user's profile for reuse.

---

## 7. Payments

Payment is handled via **Flutterwave payment link** — a static URL that Flutterwave generates which takes the customer to a hosted payment page.

### Current state
All payment buttons ("Buy Now" in the modal and "Proceed to Payment" in the cart) link to `'#'` as a placeholder.

### How to update
1. Generate a payment link at [flutterwave.com](https://flutterwave.com)
2. In `main.js`, update each product's `paymentLink` field:
```js
paymentLink: 'https://flutterwave.com/pay/YOUR_LINK_HERE'
```
3. The cart's checkout button is in `cart.updateUI()` — update `checkoutBtn.href`

### Future plan
Replace the static Flutterwave link with the **Flutterwave API** (inline checkout) so the payment modal opens directly on the site without redirecting. This requires a Flutterwave public key and a small server-side function (can be a Netlify Function).

## 8. Contact Details (live)

| Type | Value |
|---|---|
| Phone | +234 814 363 1189 |
| WhatsApp | https://wa.me/2348143631189 |
| Instagram | https://www.instagram.com/wear.tam |
| Email | hello@weartam.com (placeholder — update with real email) |
| Location | Abuja, Nigeria |

Social links for TikTok, Twitter/X, Facebook, and Pinterest are present in the HTML but still set to `href="#"` — update when handles are available.

---

## 9. Hosting

**Platform:** Netlify
**Type:** Static site (no server-side rendering)
**Deploy method:** Connect GitHub repo to Netlify, auto-deploys on push to main branch

The site is pure static files so Netlify serves it directly with no build step needed.

---

## 10. Planned Backend — Supabase

This is the next major phase of development.

### Why Supabase
- Free tier handles TAM's current scale easily
- Built-in authentication (email/password, Google OAuth)
- PostgreSQL database with a clean API
- Works perfectly with vanilla JS — no framework needed
- Netlify + Supabase is a well-documented, production-proven stack

### Supabase project setup steps
1. Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project (name: `weartam`, region: closest to Nigeria — likely EU West)
3. Note down: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (public key, safe to use in frontend JS)
4. Create the tables below

### Database Schema

#### Table: `profiles`
Extends Supabase's built-in `auth.users` table.
```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade primary key,
  full_name text,
  phone text,
  delivery_address text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

#### Table: `measurements`
```sql
create table measurements (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade,
  bust numeric,
  waist numeric,
  hips numeric,
  height numeric,
  shoulder_width numeric,
  sleeve_length numeric,
  thigh numeric,
  inseam numeric,
  back_length numeric,
  neck numeric,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

#### Table: `products`
```sql
create table products (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  description text,
  price numeric not null,
  category text,
  images text[],           -- array of image URLs (stored in Supabase Storage)
  badge text,              -- 'new', 'bestseller', 'limited', 'sale', null
  in_stock boolean default true,
  sale_price numeric,      -- null if not on sale
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

#### Table: `orders`
```sql
create table orders (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users,   -- null for guest orders
  customer_name text,
  customer_email text,
  customer_phone text,
  items jsonb,             -- array of {product_id, name, size/measurements, price, qty}
  total numeric,
  delivery_address text,
  status text default 'pending',  -- pending, processing, shipped, delivered
  payment_ref text,        -- Flutterwave transaction reference
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Enable RLS on all tables. Key policies:
- Users can only read/write their own `profiles` and `measurements`
- `products` table is publicly readable, writable only by admin role
- `orders` are readable by the order's owner and by admin

---

## 11. Planned: Authentication (Phase 2)

### What to build
- Login modal (email + password)
- Sign up modal (name, email, password)
- Forgot password flow (Supabase sends reset email — needs live Netlify URL)
- Persistent session (Supabase JS handles this with localStorage)
- Nav updates: person icon shows "Log In" when logged out, user's first name when logged in

### New files needed
```
assets/js/auth.js       # Supabase auth logic
assets/js/supabase.js   # Supabase client init (import from CDN)
account.html            # User account page
```

### Auth flow
```
User clicks "Log In" in nav
  → Modal opens
  → Enters email + password
  → Supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()
  → On success: modal closes, nav updates, measurements pre-fill
  → Session stored in localStorage by Supabase client
  → On page refresh: session auto-restored
```

---

## 12. Planned: Admin Panel (Phase 3)

A separate password-protected dashboard for the brand owner.

### Access
- Separate URL: `weartam.netlify.app/admin`
- Protected by Supabase auth with an `is_admin` flag on the user's profile
- Only accounts with `is_admin = true` can access it

### Admin panel features

#### Products manager
- View all products in a table
- Add new product: upload photos (to Supabase Storage), set name, price, category, badge, stock status
- Edit existing product
- Toggle in stock / out of stock
- Set sale price (triggers "On Sale" badge on the storefront)
- Delete product

#### Orders manager
- View all incoming orders
- Filter by status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered)
- Click an order to see full details: customer info, items, measurements if provided, delivery address
- Update order status (triggers status change in DB)

#### Customers manager
- View all registered users
- See their saved measurements
- View their order history

#### Content manager (optional later)
- Update hero video
- Update lookbook photos

### New files needed
```
admin/
├── index.html          # Admin dashboard
├── products.html       # Products management
├── orders.html         # Orders management
├── customers.html      # Customers management
└── assets/

## 14. Key Design Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | None (vanilla JS) | Fastest load, no build tools, easy to hand off |
| Single page vs multi page | Single page | Premium feel, smooth scroll, faster for MVP |
| Payment | Flutterwave link | Nigerian payment processor, no backend needed for MVP |
| Logo display | CSS text logo | Real logo file has white background, transparent export needed |
| Size system | Dual mode (standard + custom measurements) | Serves both ready-to-wear and made-to-order customers |
| Hosting | Netlify | Free, fast, auto-deploys from Git |
| Backend (planned) | Supabase | Free tier, built-in auth, works with vanilla JS, Nigerian-friendly |
| Cursor | Custom CSS cursor | Elevates the editorial fashion feel on desktop |
| Hero | Video background with dark overlay | More premium and immersive than static image |

---

## 15. External Dependencies

All loaded via CDN — no npm, no package.json.

| Dependency | Version | URL | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Fonts | Latest | fonts.googleapis.com | Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, Dancing Script |
| Font Awesome | 6.5.0 | cdnjs.cloudflare.com | All icons throughout the site |
| Supabase JS | TBD | cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js | To be added in Phase 2 |

---

## 16. Browser and Device Support

| Target | Support level |
|---|---|
| Chrome (latest) | Full |
| Firefox (latest) | Full |
| Safari (latest) | Full |
| Edge (latest) | Full |
| Mobile Chrome (Android) | Full — mobile-first CSS |
| Mobile Safari (iOS) | Full — uses `dvh` units for proper viewport height |
| IE 11 | Not supported |

Custom cursor is automatically disabled on touch/mobile devices via `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)')`.

---

## 17. Performance Notes

- Fonts loaded with `preconnect` hints for speed
- Images should be optimised to WebP format when real photos are added
- Hero video should be compressed — target under 10MB for fast load
- No JavaScript frameworks means no bundle overhead
- Netlify CDN handles global delivery
